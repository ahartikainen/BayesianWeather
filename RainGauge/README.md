# Precipitation measurements

Example of homemade rain gauge precipitation measurements with the help of kids toy-buckets and some bayesian mathematics.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_gauge

Measurements were done overnight between 24.-25.7.2020.

## Weather station measurements
Espoo, Nuuksio, <15 km from the measurement location
Espoo, Tapiola, <15 km from the measurement location

## Problem definition

The aim is to estimate precipitation based on simple measurement setup.
Two buckets (blue and yellow) were left outside overnight to gather rain precipitation.
The diameter of the bucket was measured a few times with a tape measure.
At the morning next day, the buckets were weighted with and without the precipitated water.
Scale was tared between the measurements and the buckets were placed approximately center.

Scale used for the weighting has approximately absolute accuracy of +/- 2 grams and the result is rounded to the closest 1 gram.
Tape measure results were inferred from the photograph and are given +/- 2 centimeter accuracy.
